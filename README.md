## UX


### Design Choices



### Colors
- The Colour combination used in this project represents the clarity and contrast which creates appealing sensation.
- Contrast is the most important thing regarding the choice of colours. So, it could be easy for young ones who are still learning "symbols" that are letters and words and also for older people having visual impairment.

### BUGS

I have faced several issues while making my first project but Mentioned below are the Most important bugs that I have managed to fix:-

**File path issue**
- File path was not correct '/' was present instead of index.html in the main page so in order to correct it syntax has been changed.


**Index.html failed validation**
- 12 errors were notified in the validation process in order to remove them context on few lines were changed/edited. 


**Questions quantity issue**
- Questions were not showing up appropriately in order to fix that "<a onclick="startGame()"class="btn">Play</a>" was added.



**Audio issue**
- The audio wasn't working as file path was wrong in html page.In order to fix that changed the file path.



**Content on various devices**

- The content looked really vague when tested on different devices So, I order to fix them I added class to my sections which is body-text which limits the max width.I also adjusted child paragraphs to have better spacing and line heights.


**Choice container issue**

- Background color ws missing in order to fix that '.choice container' properties were added and modified.

**Question Mark issue**

- Some of the questions were showing ?? as twice so in order to fix that searched for all those questions and removed additional ??.

- Apart from these all other validation issues were identified & fixed.
 

### Outstanding Defects
