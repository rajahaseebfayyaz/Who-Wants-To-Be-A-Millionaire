### BUGS

I have faced several issues while making my first project but Mentioned below are the Most important bugs that I have managed to fix:-

**Sign up page navigation issue**

- The signup link wasn't underlined but about was so in order to fix this I moved the active class over to the sign up link.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87448281/138536262-fdbcf258-bb89-448e-a406-45d601dd169d.png)


**Index.html failed validation**

- The markdown validator indicated that page contains mismatched section tag,In order to fix this I have deleted the extra opening section tags.

**Gallery images space issue**

- The gallery images had a lot of extra space in between which was not looking proficient,So in order to fix this I have added `<a>` tag to the images to scroll down to section below but my css query wasn't working anymore I had to update `#photos > img` to include the `<a>` tag.It became `#photos a > img` so the 100% width should apply.

**Sign up page background issue**

- The background image in the sign up page was covering the header as well making it really hard for user to see and that wasn't user friendly,So I noticed it was missing h1 logo in html and I just put it in and it was fixed.

**Content on various devices**

- The content looked really vague when tested on different devices So, I order to fix them I added class to my sections which is body-text which limits the max width to 1200px.I also adjusted child paragraphs to have better spacing and line heights.
